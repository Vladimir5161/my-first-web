          "Game of Thrones Season 2 drops Thrones fans into a world torn apart by the death of Eddard Stark. The Game of Thrones second season aired on HBO in 2012, and with all the plot twists and new characters GoT throws at viewers with each new season, and even each new episode, it`s always good to refresh your memory with a quick summary, and that`s exactly what you`ll find in this Game of Thrones season 2 recap.As GoT season 2 opens, The War of the Five Kings is raging on, and Robb Stark`s army is growing while Stannis and his Red Priestess plan to take over the kingdom. There are dragons in Essos, white walkers beyond the wall, and Greyjoys holding Winterfell. Each of the Game of Thrones season 2 episodes seemed to be more complex than the previous one. Refresh your memory with this Game of Thrones season 2 episode list and summary."
