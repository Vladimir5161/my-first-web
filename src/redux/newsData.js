      "Vikings Valhalla, set 100 years after the original series, will follow some familiar characters. Leif Erickson, Freydis, Harald Hardrada and William the Conqueror are set to make an appearance. However the news raises some questions, as Freydis was killed by Ivar the Boneless in season five. It will be interesting to see how this one plays out. Netflix announced the news on Twitter, revealing that the historical drama will be leaving History Channel. In a short notice it read: ‘#Vikings creator Michael Hirst is picking up — almost — where he left off with #VikingsValhalla, a new series set 100 years after the original. ‘This saga will follow the most famous Vikings who ever lived: Leif Erickson, Freydis, Harald Harada, and William the Conqueror! Before we get to that, there’s the small business of the final season of Vikings to watch first. A new trailer for season six didn’t go down well with fans as they felt it gave away the death of a major character. Hopefully any upcoming teasers will be a bit more…teasery. The new season could also see a potential team up between Ivar (Alex Høgh Andersen) and Prince Oleg (Danila Kozlovsky), and Lagertha (Kathryn Winnick) seemingly go back on her word to not get involved in any more battles."

      "The real Prince Oleg of Novgorod is not named in historical sources as invading Scandinavia.The sources which detail his life are The Rus’ Chronicles, The East Slavic Chronicles and The Primary Chronicle, credit him as ruling all or part of the Rus’ people during the late 9th and early 10th centuries.He is also credited as laying the foundation of the power state of Kievan Rus’ with the help of the Rus’ people.The Kievan Rus’ was a loose federation of East Slavic and Finnic people in Europe, which covers present-day Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.The term “Rus People” or “Viking Rus” is the name given to ethnically Scandinavian people who were trading and raiding on the river-routes between the Baltic and Black Seas between the eighth and 10th century. The Rus People based themselves among the Slavic and Volga Finns in the upper Volga region, trading furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities.This means Oleg did come into contact with people from Scandinavia and ruled over many of them, but he did not attack or plunder the country.Oleg focused his raids on Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, successfully launching at least one attack. Four Viking Kings - Olaf I of Norway, Olaf II of Norway, Magnus I of Norway and Harald Hardrada - sought refuge in Novgorod from enemies in Norway. Historians debate over the exact period of his reign due to the inconsistency in the sources, but Oleg is believed to have been in power from around 880 until 912.In the first trailer for Vikings season six, Ivar asked Oleg to join him to fight against “our brothers”, as he tries to regain his power in Scandinavia and Europe. Ivar had been overthrown by his older brother Bjorn Ironside (Alexander Ludwig) at the end of Vikings season five, de-throning his brother has the ruler of Kattegat. In the second trailer for season six of Vikings, Oleg tells Ivar the Boneless that he wants to invade Scandinavia. He says: “I have decided to treat your arrival here as a sign Ivar the Boneless. I have ordered the construction of a great fleet, for the invasion of Scandinavia. And you can help and be avenged upon your brothers. The Rus are coming."

      "Yes, despite the former queen basically going into retirement, it seems she will be showing off her warrior skills for a final time in the sixth season of the History Channel hit. When making an appearance at San Diego Comic Con, the 41-year-old spoke about the next chapter in Lag’s life, and how she will evolve in the finale. Chatting to ET Canada, the actress explained how before every shoot she went through two and a half hours of prosthetic work, as director Michael Hirst wanted the character to age. The star laughed: ‘They ended up doing latex on the eyes and neck to be able to show the progress age takes. She is a granny now!’ Katheryn continued: ‘I feel as though it’s a new chapter of her life, she is trying to now redefine who she is as someone who is a grandmother and used to be a queen, and a warrior, and now finding new peace. Addressing the epic battle scenes that we have seen throughout the series, she went onto reassure fans that there will be at least one more – for Lagertha, anyway. ‘It’s going to be adventurous, it’s going to be amazing,’ Katheryn beamed: ‘I’ll tell you one thing though, she is definitely not done fighting yet.’ She added: ‘There is still one big battle left to come.’ Katheryn recently announced that not only will she be appearing in the show as Lagertha, but the eighth episode of the upcoming season will also be her directorial debut. Sharing a picture of herself at SDCC, the star wrote to her 3.3million followers: ‘Comic Con 2019!"
