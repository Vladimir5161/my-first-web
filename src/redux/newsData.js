      "Vikings Valhalla, set 100 years after the original series, will follow some familiar characters. Leif Erickson, Freydis, Harald Hardrada and William the Conqueror are set to make an appearance. However the news raises some questions, as Freydis was killed by Ivar the Boneless in season five. It will be interesting to see how this one plays out. Netflix announced the news on Twitter, revealing that the historical drama will be leaving History Channel. In a short notice it read: ‘#Vikings creator Michael Hirst is picking up — almost — where he left off with #VikingsValhalla, a new series set 100 years after the original. ‘This saga will follow the most famous Vikings who ever lived: Leif Erickson, Freydis, Harald Harada, and William the Conqueror! Before we get to that, there’s the small business of the final season of Vikings to watch first. A new trailer for season six didn’t go down well with fans as they felt it gave away the death of a major character. Hopefully any upcoming teasers will be a bit more…teasery. The new season could also see a potential team up between Ivar (Alex Høgh Andersen) and Prince Oleg (Danila Kozlovsky), and Lagertha (Kathryn Winnick) seemingly go back on her word to not get involved in any more battles."
